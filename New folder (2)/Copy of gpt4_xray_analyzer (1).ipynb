There is a moderate-sized area of altered signal intensity showing diffusion restriction in the left parieto-occipital region extending into the adjacent left posterior temporal lobe. This finding is consistent with an acute/subacute infarct, suggesting that there has been a recent stroke in the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery (MCA).\n","\n","2. The infarcted area displays hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal on T2/FLAIR images, which is typical for cerebral infarction at a certain stage of evolution. No T1 hyperintensity is noted, which means there is no evidence of hemorrhage within the infarcted area.\n","\n","3. There is cortical sulci, sylvian fissures, and other cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces prominence in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres with prominence of bilateral lateral and third ventricles. This finding suggests diffuse cerebral atrophy, which is a loss of brain volume that can be associated with aging or neurodegenerative diseases.\n","\n","4. There are bilaterally symmetrical foci of signal intensity alterations that are hyperintense on T2, T2 FLAIR, and hypointense on T1-weighted images in the periventricular white matter in the bilateral fronto-parietal lobes. These findings are suggestive of ischemic demyelination, which could be consistent with small vessel disease such as that seen in chronic microvascular ischemic changes (Fazekas grade III).\n","\n","5. The basal ganglia, thalami, and corpus callosum show normal signal intensity and differentiation, which means there is no abnormality detected in these areas.\n","\n","6. The brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres are normal in morphology, signal intensity, and outline, indicating no abnormalities in these regions.\n","\n","7. The fourth ventricle is normal in size and configuration, and the flow void is seen, which is a normal finding indicating patency of the cerebrospinal fluid pathways.\n","\n","8. A partial empty sella is observed, which can be a normal variant or associated with intracranial hypertension.\n","\n","The overall impression from the MRI report is that there is an acute/subacute infarct in the left MCA territory, age-appropriate diffuse cerebral atrophy, and ischemic demyelination. These findings would be important for the medical professionals managing the patient's care, as they suggest a vascular event and chronic small vessel disease, which may require specific medical treatment and possibly lifestyle modifications to manage risk factors for further vascular events.\n"]}],"source":["image_path = \"./mri_report_image_format.jpg\"\n","user_prompt_content = \"Please analyze the given image of MRI report and explain for medical professionals.\"\n","print(llm_output(system_prompt_content, user_prompt_content, image_path))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WGg8pM-qXVub","outputId":"bd536c84-3427-4b97-e83a-126e0e78063e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["The MRI report you've provided describes several findings in the brain, which I will explain in simpler terms:\n","\n","1. There is an area in the left side of the brain, specifically in the parieto-occipital region (which is near the back and top of the head), that shows changes in signal intensity. This means that part of the brain tissue appears different from normal on the MRI scan. The term \"diffusion restriction\" suggests that there is a limitation in the movement of water molecules in this area, which is often a sign of a recent stroke or brain infarction (an area of dead tissue due to lack of blood supply).\n","\n","2. The report also mentions that the brain's outer layer (cortex) in this region is not showing the usual bright signal on a particular type of MRI sequence (T1 images), and it is not showing the dark signal on another type (T2/FLAIR images). This could be related to the same area affected by the stroke.\n","\n","3. The fluid-filled spaces in the brain, known as ventricles and sulci, are more prominent than usual, which could indicate brain atrophy (shrinkage) or loss of brain tissue. This is also described as \"diffuse cerebral atrophy.\"\n","\n","4. There are symmetrical changes in the white matter of the brain, which is the part that contains nerve fibers. These changes are seen as bright signals on T2 and FLAIR images, which could suggest small vessel disease or ischemic demyelination (damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers due to reduced blood flow), which is common in older adults.\n","\n","5. The report mentions Fazekas grade III, which is a way to describe the severity of white matter changes seen on the MRI. Grade III indicates more severe changes.\n","\n","6. The rest of the brain structures, including the brainstem and cerebellum, appear normal.\n","\n","7. The pituitary gland, which is a small gland at the base of the brain, is partially empty, which is noted as \"partial empty sella.\" This can be a normal variant or related to other conditions.\n","\n","In summary, the MRI shows signs of a recent small stroke in the left parieto-occipital region, changes in the white matter that suggest small vessel disease or ischemic demyelination, and general brain shrinkage that is age-appropriate. It's important for the person with these MRI findings to follow up with their healthcare provider for further evaluation and management.\n"]}],"source":["image_path = \"./mri_report_image_format.jpg\"\n","user_prompt_content = \"Please analyze the given image of MRI report and explain for laymen who don't have medical knowledge.\"\n","print(llm_output(system_prompt_content, user_prompt_content, image_path))\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"base","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/sanigam/gpt4_xray_analyzer/blob/main/gpt4_xray_analyzer.ipynb","timestamp":1709454331739}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
