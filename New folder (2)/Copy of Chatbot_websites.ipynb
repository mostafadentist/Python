Left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke. In fact, a person with diabetes and high blood pressure is four times as likely to develop heart disease than someone who does not have either of the conditions. About two-thirds of adults with diabetes have blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg or use prescription medications for hypertension.\\n\\nThe Brain Connection\\n\\nHypertension in midlife could affect late-life thinking skills. Discover what Johns Hopkins researchers know about the connection, plus ways to keep your blood pressure under control and your brain at its best.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nWhat is high blood pressure?\\n\\nBlood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls. Each time the heart beats, it is pumping blood into these arteries, resulting in the highest blood pressure when the heart contracts and is pumping the blood. High blood pressure, or hypertension, directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (heart attack) and stroke (brain attack). With high blood pressure, the arteries may have an increased resistance against the flow of blood, causing the heart to pump harder to circulate the blood.\\n\\nTwo numbers are used to measure blood pressure. The number on the top, the systolic pressure, refers to the pressure inside the artery when the heart contracts and is pumping the blood through the body. The number on the bottom, the diastolic pressure, refers to the pressure inside the artery when the heart is at rest and is filling with blood. Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are recorded as \"mm Hg\" (millimeters of mercury).According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NHLBI), high blood pressure for adults is defined as:\\n\\n140 mm Hg or greater systolic pressure \\t\\tand\\n\\n90 mm Hg or greater diastolic pressure\\n\\nNHLBI guidelines for prehypertension are:\\n\\n120 mm Hg – 139 mm Hg systolic pressure \\t\\tand\\n\\n80 mm Hg – 89 mm Hg diastolic pressure\\n\\nNHLBI guidelines define normal blood pressure as follows:\\n\\nLess than 120 mm Hg systolic pressure \\t\\tand\\n\\nLess than 80 mm Hg diastolic pressure\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\\n\\nOften, people with high blood pressure do not have noticeable symptoms. If the blood pressure is greatly elevated, a person may experience the following. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently.

Treatment may vary depending on your diagnosis, health, and other factors.\\n\\nIn May 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that some makers of extended-release metformin remove some of their tablets from the U.S. market. This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets. If you currently take this drug, call a healthcare professional. They will advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription.\\n\\nDiabetes is a condition that leads to high levels of blood glucose (sugar) in the body.\\n\\nThis reaction happens when your body can’t make or use the hormone insulin like it’s supposed to. Produced by the pancreas, insulin helps your body use the sugar from the food you eat.\\n\\nThere are two major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. People with either type need medications to help manage their blood sugar levels.\\n\\nThe types of medications you take will depend on the type of diabetes you have. Learn more about the available treatment options.\\n\\nMedications for type 1 diabetes\\n\\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, your body can’t make its own insulin. The goal of treatment is to replace the insulin that your pancreas can’t make.\\n\\nInsulin\\n\\nInsulin is the most common type of medication used in type 1 diabetes treatment. There are more than 20 types sold in the United States.\\n\\nIt’s given as an infusion under the skin (with the help of an insulin pump) or as an injection.\\n\\nThere are multiple types of insulin. They vary based on how quickly they start working, how long they work, and whether they have a peak level of action.\\n\\nThe type of insulin you need depends on your body’s sensitivity to insulin and the severity of your insulin deficiency. These include the following:\\n\\nShort-acting insulin:\\n\\nRegular or “short-acting” insulin may reach the bloodstream 30 minutes after injection and peak 2-3 hours afterward. These injections also work up to 3-6 hours.\\n\\nTypes of regular insulin include:\\n\\nHumulin R U-100\\n\\nNovolin R FlexPen\\n\\nNovolin R ReliOn\\n\\nNovolin R FlexPen ReliOn\\n\\nRapid-acting insulin:\\n\\nAs the name suggests, rapid-acting insulin works within 15 minutes. The peak time is 1 to 2 hours after use, and the medication lasts between 2 and 4 hours.\\n\\nThe available types of rapid-acting insulin include:\\n\\ninhaled insulin (Afrezza)\\n\\ninsulin aspart (Fiasp, Fiasp FlexTouch, Fiasp PenFill, NovoLog, NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog FlexTouch, NovoLog PenFill, ReliOn NovoLog, ReliOn NovoLog FlexPen)\\n\\ninsulin glulisine (Apidra, Apidra SoloStar), which is only available as a brand-name drug\\n\\ninsulin lispro (Admelog, Admelog SoloStar, Humalog, Humalog KwikPen, Humalog Junior KwikPen)\\n\\ninsulin lispro-aabc (Lyumjev, Lyumjev KwikPen)\\n\\nIntermediate-acting insulin:\\n\\nIntermediate-acting insulin works about 2-4 hours after use, with an average peak time of 12 hours. You can expect this type of insulin to last between 12 and 18 hours.\\n\\nExamples include:\\n\\ninsulin isophane (Humulin N U-100, Humulin N KwikPen, Novolin N, Novolin N FlexPen, Novolin N ReliOn, Novolin N FlexPen ReliOn)\\n\\nLong-acting insulin:\\n\\nLong-lasting insulin helps lower your blood glucose levels for up to 24 hours or longer, and it reaches your bloodstream more gradually.\\n\\nThe types of available long-acting insulin include:\\n\\ninsulin degludec (Tresiba, Tresiba FlexTouch)\\n\\ninsulin detemir (Levemir)\\n\\ninsulin glargine (Basaglar KwikPen, Lantus, Lantus SoloStar, Toujeo SoloStar, Toujeo Max SoloStar)\\n\\ninsulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee-yfgn)\\n\\nconcentrated regular insulin (Humulin R U-500, Humulin R U-500 KwikPen)\\n\\nCombination (premixed) insulins:\\n\\ninsulin aspart protamine/insulin aspart 70/30 (NovoLog Mix 70/30, NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen)\\n\\ninsulin isophane/regular insulin 70/30 (Humulin 70/30, Humulin 70/30 KwikPen, Novolin 70/30, Novolin 70/30 FlexPen, Novolin 70/30 FlexPen ReliOn)\\n\\ninsulin lispro protamine/insulin lispro 50/50 (Humalog Mix 50/50, Humalog Mix 50/50 KwikPen)\\n\\ninsulin lispro protamine/insulin lispro 75/25 (Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog Mix 75/25 KwikPen)\\n\\nAmylinomimetic injectables\\n\\nPramlintide (SymlinPen) is an amylinomimetic. It’s an injectable medication that’s used before meals.\\n\\nIt works by delaying the time your stomach takes to empty itself. It also reduces the secretion of the hormone glucagon after meals. These actions lower your blood sugar.\\n\\nPramlintide reduces appetite, too.\\n\\nMedications for type 2 diabetes\\n\\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin but no longer uses it well. Your body can’t make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels within an optimal range.\\n\\nThe goal of your treatment is to help your body use insulin better or to get rid of extra glucose in your blood.\\n\\nMost medications for type 2 diabetes are oral drugs. However, insulin or injectables may also be used. Some of these medications are combinations of more than one diabetes drug.\\n\\nInsulin\\n\\nSome people with type 2 diabetes may also need to take insulin. The same types of insulin used to treat type 1 diabetes can also treat type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nA doctor may recommend the aforementioned types of insulin used in type 1 diabetes treatment for type 2 diabetes. As with type 1 diabetes, this depends on the type of insulin needed and how severe your insulin deficiency is. See the above types of insulin to discuss with a doctor.\\n\\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors\\n\\nThese medications help your body break down starchy foods and table sugar. This effect lowers your blood sugar levels.\\n\\nWhen taken as prescribed, these medications won’t cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, your risk of hypoglycemia may be greater if you take them with other types of diabetes medications.\\n\\nFor best results, take alpha-glucosidase inhibitors before meals. These medications include:\\n\\nacarbose\\n\\nmiglitol (Glyset)\\n\\nBiguanides\\n\\nBiguanides decrease how much glucose your liver makes. They also decrease how much glucose your intestines absorb, help your muscles absorb glucose, and make your body more sensitive to insulin.\\n\\nThe most common biguanide is metformin (Glumetza, Riomet, Riomet ER).\\n\\nMetformin is considered the most commonly prescribed oral medication for type 2 diabetes, and it can also be combined with other type 2 diabetes medications. It’s an ingredient in the following medications:\\n\\nmetformin-alogliptin (Kazano)\\n\\nmetformin-canagliflozin (Invokamet)\\n\\nmetformin-dapagliflozin (Xigduo XR)\\n\\nmetformin-empagliflozin (Synjardy)\\n\\nmetmorfin-ertugliflozin (Segluromet)\\n\\nmetformin-glipizide\\n\\nmetformin-glyburide (Glucovance)\\n\\nmetformin-linagliptin (Jentadueto, Jentadueto XR)\\n\\nmetformin-pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Actoplus Met XR)\\n\\nmetformin-repaglinide (PrandiMet)\\n\\nmetformin-rosiglitazone (Avandamet)\\n\\nmetformin-saxagliptin (Kombiglyze XR)\\n\\nmetformin-sitagliptin (Janumet, Janumet XR)\\n\\nDopamine-2 agonist\\n\\nBromocriptine (Cycloset, Parlodel) is a dopamine-2 agonist.\\n\\nIt’s unknown exactly how this drug treats type 2 diabetes. It may affect rhythms in your body and prevent insulin resistance. According to one 2015 review, dopamine-2 agonists may also improve other related health concerns, such as high cholesterol or weight management.\\n\\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors are used to help reduce blood sugar without causing hypoglycemia.\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors block the DPP-4 enzyme. This enzyme destroys a hormone called incretin, which normally helps your body produce insulin when it’s needed. Incretins also decrease glucose output from the liver when your body doesn’t need it.\\n\\nThese drugs can also help the pancreas make more insulin.\\n\\nExamples of DPP-4 inhibitors include:\\n\\nalogliptin (Nesina)\\n\\nalogliptin-metformin (Kazano)\\n\\nlinagliptin (Tradjenta)\\n\\nlinagliptin-empagliflozin (Glyxambi)\\n\\nlinagliptin-metformin (Jentadueto, Jentadueto XR)\\n\\nsaxagliptin (Onglyza)\\n\\nsaxagliptin-metformin (Kombiglyze XR)\\n\\nsitagliptin (Januvia)\\n\\nsitagliptin-metformin (Janumet and Janumet XR)\\n\\nsitagliptin and simvastatin (Juvisync)\\n\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 receptor agonists)\\n\\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are similar to incretin and may be prescribed in addition to a diet and exercise plan to help promote better glycemic control.\\n\\nThey increase how much insulin your body uses and the growth of pancreatic beta cells. They decrease your appetite and how much glucagon your body uses. They also slow stomach emptying, which may maximize nutrient absorption from the foods you eat while potentially helping you maintain or lose weight.\\n\\nThese are all important actions for people with diabetes.\\n\\nFor some people, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease may predominate over their diabetes. In these cases, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends certain GLP-1 receptor agonists as part of an antihyperglycemic treatment regimen.\\n\\nThese drugs include:\\n\\ndulaglutide (Trulicity)\\n\\nexenatide (Byetta)\\n\\nexenatide extended-release (Bydureon BCise)\\n\\nliraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza)\\n\\nlixisenatide (Adylyxin)\\n\\nsemaglutide (Ozempic)\\n\\ntirzepatide (Mounjaro)\\n\\nMeglitinides\\n\\nThese medications help your body release insulin. However, they aren’t for everyone. In some cases, they may lower your blood sugar too much, especially if you have advanced kidney disease.\\n\\nThese drugs include:\\n\\nnateglinide (Starlix)\\n\\nrepaglinide (Prandin)\\n\\nSodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors\\n\\nSodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from holding on to glucose. Instead, your body gets rid of the glucose through your urine.\\n\\nAgain, in cases where atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease predominate, the ADA recommends SGLT2 inhibitors as a possible treatment option. Examples include:\\n\\ncanagliflozin (Invokana)\\n\\ncanagliflozin-metformin (Invokamet, Invokamet XR)\\n\\ndapagliflozin (Farxiga)\\n\\ndapagliflozin-metformin (Xigduo XR)\\n\\ndapagliflozin-saxagliptin (Qtern)\\n\\nempagliflozin (Jardiance)\\n\\nempagliflozin-linagliptin (Glyxambi)\\n\\nempaglifozin-linagliptin-metmorfin (Trijardy XR)\\n\\nempagliflozin-metformin (Synjardy, Synjardy XR)\\n\\nertugliflozin (Steglatro)\\n\\nSulfonylureas\\n\\nThese are among the oldest diabetes drugs still used today. They work by stimulating the pancreas with the help of beta cells. This causes your body to make more insulin.\\n\\nThese drugs include:\\n\\nglimepiride (Amaryl)\\n\\nglimepiride-pioglitazone (Duetact)\\n\\ngliclazide\\n\\nglipizide\\n\\nglipizide ER (Glipizide XL, Glucotrol XL)\\n\\nglipizide-metformin\\n\\nglyburide (Glynase)\\n\\nglyburide-metformin\\n\\nThiazolidinediones\\n\\nThiazolidinediones work by decreasing glucose in your liver. They also help your fat cells use insulin better by targeting insulin resistance.\\n\\nThese drugs come with an increased risk of heart disease. If your doctor gives you one of these drugs, they’ll watch your heart function during treatment.\\n\\nOptions include:\\n\\nrosiglitazone\\n\\npioglitazone-alogliptin (Oseni)\\n\\npioglitazone-glimepiride (Duetact)\\n\\npioglitazone-metformin (Actoplus Met, Actoplus Met XR)\\n\\nOther drugs\\n\\nPeople with type 1 and type 2 diabetes often need to take other medications to treat conditions that are common with diabetes.\\n\\nThese drugs can include:\\n\\naspirin for heart health\\n\\nmedications for high cholesterol\\n\\nhigh blood pressure medications\\n\\nTalk with a doctor\\n\\nMany medications are available to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. They each work in different ways to help you control your blood sugar.\\n\\nAsk a doctor which diabetes drug may be the best fit for you. They will make recommendations based on the type of diabetes you have, your health, and other factors. It’s also important to know that new medications for diabetes are constantly being investigated for approval.\\n\\nRead this article in Spanish.\\n\\nLast medically reviewed on  October 13, 2022\\n\\nHow we reviewed this article:\\n\\nSources\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations.

Testing is simple, and results are usually available quickly.\\n\\nTests for Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, and Prediabetes\\n\\nYour doctor will have you take one or more of the following blood tests to confirm the diagnosis:\\n\\nA1C Test\\n\\nThe A1C test\\xa0measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 or 3 months. An A1C below 5.7% is normal, between 5.7 and 6.4% indicates you have prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates you have diabetes.\\n\\nFasting Blood Sugar Test\\n\\nThis measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.\\n\\nGlucose Tolerance Test\\n\\nThis measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. At 2 hours, a blood sugar level of 140 mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 140 to 199 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.\\n\\nRandom Blood Sugar Test\\n\\nThis measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You can take this test at any time and don’t need to fast (not eat) first. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.\\n\\nResult*\\n\\n6.5% or above\\n\\n126 mg/dL or above\\n\\n200 mg/dL or above\\n\\n200 mg/dL or above\\n\\n5.7 – 6.4%\\n\\n100 – 125 mg/dL\\n\\n140 – 199 mg/dL\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nBelow 5.7%\\n\\n99 mg/dL or below\\n\\n140 mg/dL or below\\n\\nN/A\\n\\nResults for gestational diabetes can differ. Ask your health care provider what your results mean if you’re being tested for gestational diabetes.\\nSource: American Diabetes Association\\n\\nIf your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also tested for autoantibodies (substances that indicate your body is attacking itself) that are often present in type 1 diabetes but not in type 2 diabetes. You may have your urine tested for ketones (produced when your body burns fat for energy), which also indicate type 1 diabetes instead of type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nTests for Gestational Diabetes\\n\\nGestational diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests. You’ll probably be tested between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If your risk is higher for getting gestational diabetes (due to having more risk factors), your doctor may test you earlier. Blood sugar that’s higher than normal early in your pregnancy may indicate you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes rather than gestational diabetes.\\n\\nGlucose Screening Test\\n\\nThis measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You’ll drink a liquid that contains glucose, and then 1 hour later your blood will be drawn to check your blood sugar level. A normal result is 140 mg/dL or lower. If your level is higher than 140 mg/dL, you’ll need to take a glucose tolerance test.\\n\\nGlucose Tolerance Test\\n\\nThis measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. Results can differ depending on the size of the glucose drink and how often your blood sugar is tested. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.\\n\\nPrevent Type 2 Diabetes\\n\\nIf your test results show you have prediabetes, ask your doctor or nurse if the lifestyle change program offered through the CDC-led\\xa0National Diabetes Prevention Program is available in your community. You can also search for an online or in-person program. Having prediabetes puts you at greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes, but participating in the program can lower your risk by as much as 58% (71% if you’re over age 60).\\n\\nDiabetes Treatment

The signal then travels through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and passes into the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the atria (typically pulmonary veins), causing them to beat chaotically. Since the atrioventricular (AV) node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the ventricles, the heart beats faster and irregularly.\\nAtrial fibrillation (A-fib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. A-fib increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\\nDuring atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly — out of sync with the lower chambers (the ventricles) of the heart. For many people, A-fib may have no symptoms. However, A-fib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat (palpitations), shortness of breath or weakness.\\nEpisodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. Although A-fib itself usually isn't life-threatening, it's a serious medical condition that requires proper treatment to prevent stroke.\\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation may include medications, therapy to reset the heart rhythm and catheter procedures to block faulty heart signals.\\nA person with atrial fibrillation may also have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. Although atrial flutter is a different arrhythmia, the treatment is quite similar to atrial fibrillation.\\nProducts \u0026 Services\\nBook: Future Care\\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition\\nSymptoms\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624'}), Document(page_content=\"Products \u0026 Services\\nBook: Future Care\\nBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\nNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition\\nSymptoms\\nSome people with atrial fibrillation (A-fib) don't notice any symptoms. Those who do have atrial fibrillation symptoms may have signs and symptoms such as:\\nSensations of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)\\nChest pain\\nDizziness\\nFatigue\\nLightheadedness\\nReduced ability to exercise\\nShortness of breath\\nWeakness\\nAtrial fibrillation may be:\\nOccasional (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). A-fib symptoms come and go, usually lasting for a few minutes to hours. Sometimes symptoms occur for as long as a week and episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional A-fib need treatment.\\nPersistent. With this type of atrial fibrillation, the heart rhythm doesn't go back to normal on its own. If a person has A-fib symptoms, cardioversion or treatment with medications may be used to restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm.\\nLong-standing persistent.

Within the upper right chamber of the heart (right atrium) is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node is the heart's natural pacemaker. It produces the signal that starts each heartbeat.\\nIn a regular heart rhythm:\\nThe signal travels from the sinus node through the two upper heart chambers (atria).\\nThe signal passes through a pathway between the upper and lower chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624'}), Document(page_content=\"The signal travels from the sinus node through the two upper heart chambers (atria).\\nThe signal passes through a pathway between the upper and lower chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node.\\nThe movement of the signal causes your heart to squeeze (contract), sending blood to your heart and body.\\nIn atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers shake (quiver). The AV node is then bombarded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers (ventricles). This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.\\nThe heart rate in atrial fibrillation may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. The normal range for a heart rate is 60 to 100 beats a minute.\\nCauses of atrial fibrillation\\nProblems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation. Possible causes of atrial fibrillation include:\\nCoronary artery disease\\nHeart attack\\nHeart defect that you're born with (congenital heart defect)\\nHeart valve problems\\nHigh blood pressure\\nLung diseases\\nPhysical stress due to surgery, pneumonia or other illnesses\\nPrevious heart surgery\\nProblem with the heart's natural pacemaker (sick sinus syndrome)\\nSleep apnea\\nThyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) and other metabolic imbalances\\nUse of stimulants, including certain medications, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol\\nViral infections\\nSome people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart problems or heart damage.\\nRisk factors\\nThings that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (A-fib) include:\\nAge. The older a person is, the greater the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\\nHeart disease. Anyone with heart disease — such as heart valve problems, congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or a history of heart attack or heart surgery — has an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624'})]\n","Second half: [Document(page_content=\"High blood pressure. Having high blood pressure, especially if it's not well controlled with lifestyle changes or medications, can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.\\nThyroid disease. In some people, thyroid problems may trigger heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), including atrial fibrillation.\\nOther chronic health conditions. People with certain chronic conditions such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.\\nDrinking alcohol. For some people, drinking alcohol can trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation. Binge drinking further increases the risk.\\nObesity. People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\\nFamily history. An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.\\nComplications\\nBlood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation that can lead to stroke.\\nIn atrial fibrillation, the chaotic heart rhythm can cause blood to collect in the heart's upper chambers (atria) and form clots. If a blood clot in the left upper chamber (left atrium) breaks free from the heart area, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.\\nThe risk of stroke from atrial fibrillation increases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase your risk of a stroke due to A-fib, including:\\nHigh blood pressure\\nDiabetes\\nHeart failure\\nSome valvular heart disease\\nBlood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.\\nPrevention\\nHealthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation.
